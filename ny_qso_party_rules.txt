COUNTY LINE OPERA TIONS 
●
 
Portable
 
stations
 
and
 
stationary
 
mobile
 
stations
 
may
 
operate
 
on
 
a
 
county
 
line.
 
Contacts
 
with
 
these
 
stations
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
as
 
credit
 
for
 
two
 
counties.
 
Some
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
portable
 
station
 
or
 
the
 
vehicle
 
used
 
for
 
the
 
mobile
 
contact
 
must
 
be
 
located
 
in
 
each
 
county,
 
on
 
the
 
county
 
line.
 
If
 
the
 
portable
 
or
 
mobile
 
station
 
is
 
operating
 
from
 
the
 
intersection
 
of
 
three
 
or
 
more
 
NY
 
counties,
 
only
 
two
 
counties
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
may
 
be
 
counted
 
for
 
the
 
same
 
contact.
 
NYQP
 
may
 
request
 
proof
 
of
 
county
 
line
 
operation.
 
Cell
 
phone
 
photos
 
or
 
equivalent
 
documentation
 
showing
 
both
 
the
 
county
 
line
 
and
 
the
 
portable
 
or
 
mobile
 
station
 
operating
 
there
 
are
 
sufficient.
 
●
 
CW
 
and
 
digital
 
operators
 
should
 
use
 
a
 
“/”
 
to
 
separate
 
county
 
names
 
in
 
the
 
exchange.
 
County
 
line
 
exchanges
 
should
 
be
 
logged
 
as
 
two
 
separate
 
QSOs.
 
●
 
Examples
 
o
 
Phone:
 
“N2AAA,
 
59
 
Monroe
 
and
 
Orleans.”
 
o
 
CW:
 
“KX2NY
 
599
 
DUT/PUT”
 
o
 
Note:
 
sending
 
the
 
CW
 
exchange
 
with
 
the
 
slash
 
between
 
the
 
counties,
 
as
 
shown
 
above,
 
is
 
important;
 
that’s
 
how
 
the
 
logging
 
software
 
knows
 
you’re
 
on
 
a
 
county
 
line
 
and
 
gives
 
both
 
you
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
station
 
credit
 
for
 
both
 
counties.
